Description:

This directory used to include a prebuilt bin/eu-strip binary with a patch
applied that fixed stripping large debug binaries that would have otherwise
overflowed certain integer limits. This has since been fixed upstream, so
bin/eu-strip now forwards to the system eu-strip and this directory will be
removed in the future.
